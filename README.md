## Hand Written Digit Identifier from Scratch
A Django web app based on machine learning Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model from scratch (using some basic modules like numpy) and trained over MNIST handwritten digit train dataset and has an accuraccy of about 97% on MNIST test data set.<br>
Trained weights are stored in ```model_param.pkl``` file.<br>

Some limitations of this app observed by me<br>
i)  Less efficiency for digit 7.<br>
ii) Works well when digits are drawn in mid of canvas with full size.
